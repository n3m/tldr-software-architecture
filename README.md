## FAQ

- [ ] What is software architecture?

  A system's architecture acts as a blueprint. It establishes a communication and coordination mechanism among components and offers an abstraction to control the complexity of the system.
  It outlines an organized approach to address all technical and practical needs while maximizing standard quality characteristics like performance and security.

  Additionally, it entails a number of important organizational decisions connected to software development, and each of these choices can have a substantial influence on the end product's quality, maintainability, performance, and overall success. These selections include

  - Choice of the structural components and their connections, which make up the system.
  - Interactions between those elements.
  - Architectural choices support corporate goals.
